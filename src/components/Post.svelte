			Throughout my career and most recently at YouTube, I've learned that there's no single definition of
			innovation. Instead, there are many different yet equally valid ways to introduce new ideas, regardless of
			your specific process or mindset. What we've discovered at YouTube over many years and many projects is that
			our teams, products, and ultimately <a href="https://">our users</a>, greatly benefit when we use multiple,
			complementary forms of innovation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our product teams focus on two approaches: versioning and visioning. Versioning uses incremental product
			improvements that add up over time to significantly improve user experience. Visioning, in contrast, is an
			approach that addresses more open-ended questions and emphasizes longer-term thinking. At YouTube, we use
			visioning to explore uncharted terrain in the form of new users and/or new problem spaces. While perhaps
			lesser known, visioning is a technique you too can use to speed up product innovation.

			In 2014, we established a dedicated visioning team with a mission to help the company and our product teams
			explore new terrain and make bigger leaps a reality. This team which I lead focuses on exploring new areas,
			defining new features or products, and rethinking our existing products. Over the years our team has helped
			lay the groundwork for products such as YouTube Kids and YouTube Go, and launched new features like our
			community tab and interactive cards. Let's take a closer look at visioning in practice.

			Phase 2: Immerse yourself in the problem
		</h2>
		<p>
			Visioning allows us to both understand product usage, and the larger task of getting to know a new domain or
			industry. To explore a broad area like learning which encompasses everything from math to makeup tutorials
			we employed a 360-degree strategy for immersion, seeking insights from a variety of perspectives:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Industry basics:</b> We audited our existing product (YouTube) and evaluated the current options
				available in the industry to all kinds of learners. This gave us a solid foundation for the current
				state of our product and the industry at large.</li>
			<li><b>Experts and thought leaders:</b> We met with members of the World Economic Forum to help us
				understand job reskilling trends; we were inspired by programs like Arizona State University and their
				mission to democratize education by making it accessible to everyone. Insights from these experts gave
				us a glimpse into the future, and provided great inspiration for new ideas.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Empathy exercises:</b> Team members enrolled in online courses to directly experience the learning
				process. These deeply personal experiences revealed insights, particularly on the challenges of staying
				motivated to learn.
			</li>
			<li> <b>The learning ecosystem:</b> In addition to understanding our audience of people using YouTube to
				learn something new, we broadened our research plan to include creators of educational content on
				YouTube, and employers too. We made sure to invest in research across all three user types to ensure
				that we designed solutions that created value for the entire ecosystem.
			</li>
			<li><b>The whole person:</b>
				While data can be useful in understanding user behavior, understanding people on a deeper level requires
				getting out of the office and into the field. For this project, we traveled to different parts of the
				country to meet all kinds of learners and to better understand the person behind each individual user.
				We spent time with a donut glazer in Salt Lake City who was seeking a better career path but didn't see
				any viable possibilities. He revealed that he grew up fatherless and lacked a professional role model to
				guide him. From stories like these, we learned that for many people the first step of their journey to
				learn something isn't choosing a course, but the more fundamental step of discovering new directions for
				one's life. </li>
